> CSS with more utility 🪴

fuz_css is a CSS framework and design system for semantic HTML.
It styles elements by default and
integrates custom properties, themes, and utility classes into a complete system.
It's Svelte-first but works with plain HTML/JS/TS, React, Preact, Solid, and other JSX frameworks.

It's in early alpha with breaking changes ahead.
Feedback and design input is welcome in
the [discussions](https://github.com/fuzdev/fuz_css/discussions).
