> CSS framework and design system 🌿 magical organic stylesheets

Fuz CSS is a CSS framework and design system built around semantic styles and style variables.
It's in early alpha with breaking changes ahead.

**Core features:**

- semantic reset stylesheet with sensible element defaults
- style variables (design tokens as CSS custom properties)
- three class types: token classes (`p_md`, `color_a_5`), composite classes (`box`, `row`), and CSS-literal classes (`display:flex`, `hover:opacity:80%`)
- CSS-literal modifiers for responsive (`md:`), state (`hover:`), color-scheme (`dark:`), and pseudo-elements (`before:`)
- smart utility class generation - only includes classes your code actually uses
